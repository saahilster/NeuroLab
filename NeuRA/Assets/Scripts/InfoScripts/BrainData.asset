  description: "The brain is a complex organ that serves as the control center of
    the nervous system, located within the skull. It consists of several parts, including
    the cerebrum, cerebellum, and brainstem, each responsible for different functions
    such as movement, sensation, thinking, and regulating vital processes like breathing
    and heartbeat. The brain is composed of billions of neurons that communicate
    through synapses, allowing for the processing and integration of information.
    It is protected by the skull and surrounded by cerebrospinal fluid, which cushions
    it against injury. The brain\u2019s structure and function are critical for all
    aspects of human behavior, cognition, and emotion.         "
