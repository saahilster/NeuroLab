  personDescription: "In July 2016, Elaine started having a stroke which led up to
    difficulty walking. She had been taken into the Rehabilitation center for intensive
    therapy (for 14 days). In August 2018, she underwent a surgical procedure to
    place a Vagus Nerve Stimulation (VNS) device to re-establish her walking. Elaine
    was one of the first ever in the world to get the VNS surgery. \u201CThis clinical
    Research has helped me, has inspired me to do better\u2026\u201D "
