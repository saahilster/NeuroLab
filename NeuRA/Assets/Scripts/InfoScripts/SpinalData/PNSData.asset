  description: The Peripheral Nervous System (PNS) is one of the two main divisions
    of the nervous system, alongside the Central Nervous System (CNS). It consists
    of all the nerves that lie outside the brain and spinal cord. The PNS is responsible
    for transmitting signals between the CNS and the rest of the body, including
    limbs and organs. It is divided into the somatic nervous system, which controls
    voluntary movements, and the autonomic nervous system, which regulates involuntary
    functions like heart rate and digestion. The PNS plays a crucial role in coordinating
    bodily functions and responding to external stimuli.
