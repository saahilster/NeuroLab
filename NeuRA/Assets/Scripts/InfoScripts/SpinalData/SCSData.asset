  description: 'A Spinal Cord Stimulator (SCS) is a device implanted under the skin
    that sends electrical impulses to the spinal cord. These impulses help to block
    or mask pain signals before they reach the brain, effectively reducing the sensation
    of pain. SCS is primarily used to manage chronic pain conditions, such as failed
    back surgery syndrome, complex regional pain syndrome, and neuropathic pain.
    It does not cure the underlying condition but provides significant pain relief
    for many patients. The device can be adjusted or turned off as needed, offering
    customizable pain management.        '
