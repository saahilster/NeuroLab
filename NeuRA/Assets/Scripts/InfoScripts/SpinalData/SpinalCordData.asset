  description: The spinal cord is a long, cylindrical bundle of nerve fibers and
    associated tissue enclosed in the spine, extending from the brainstem down to
    the lower back. It serves as the main pathway for transmitting signals between
    the brain and the rest of the body, facilitating communication for motor and
    sensory functions. The spinal cord is protected by the vertebral column and surrounded
    by cerebrospinal fluid, which cushions it from injury. It is composed of both
    gray matter, which contains neuron cell bodies, and white matter, which consists
    of myelinated axons that conduct nerve impulses. Damage to the spinal cord can
    result in loss of sensation, movement, or autonomic function below the site of
    injury, depending on its severity and location.
