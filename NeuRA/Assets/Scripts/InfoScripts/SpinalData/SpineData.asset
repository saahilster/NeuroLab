  description: ' The spine, or vertebral column, is a vital structure composed of
    33 vertebrae, divided into cervical, thoracic, lumbar, sacral, and coccygeal
    regions. It provides essential structural support, enabling an upright posture
    and bearing the body''s weight. The spine also protects the spinal cord, a crucial
    part of the nervous system, while allowing flexibility for movements like bending
    and twisting. Intervertebral discs cushion the vertebrae, absorbing shocks from
    physical activities. Additionally, the spine serves as an attachment point for
    muscles and ligaments, stabilizing and controlling movement. Maintaining spine
    health is essential for mobility, pain prevention, and overall well-being.'
