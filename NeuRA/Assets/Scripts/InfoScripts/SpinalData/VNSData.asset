  description: ' A vagus nerve stimulator (VNS) is a medical device implanted under
    the skin, typically in the chest, with a wire that connects to the vagus nerve
    in the neck. It sends electrical impulses to the vagus nerve, which in turn affects
    brain activity. The primary use of VNS is to help control seizures in people
    with epilepsy that do not respond well to medication. It can also be used to
    treat depression in individuals who have not found relief through standard treatments.
    By modulating the vagus nerve, VNS can help stabilize mood and reduce seizure
    frequency and intensity.'
